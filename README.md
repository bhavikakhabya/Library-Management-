# 📚 Library Book Popularity Tracker  
### *Python Case Study | OOP-Based Mini Project*


---

## 🌷 About the Project
- A **Python-based Library Management System** designed to replace manual registers.
- Tracks **borrowing & returning of books automatically**.
- Calculates **book popularity** using borrow count.
- Helps librarians make **smart, data-backed decisions**.
- Built using **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)** for clarity and scalability.

---

## 💡 Why This Project?
- Manual library records are slow and error-prone.
- No visibility into **most-read or trending books**.
- This system brings **structure, automation, and insights** into library operations.
- Simple logic, real-world use, strong fundamentals ✔️

---

## ✨ Key Features
- ➕ Add new books to the library
- 📖 Borrow books only when copies are available
- 🔄 Return borrowed books smoothly
- 📊 Rank books based on popularity
- 📝 Maintain borrow & return logs automatically
- 📈 Visualize data using charts

---

## 🛠️ Technologies Used
- **Language:** Python 🐍
- **Concept:** Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)
- **Data Storage:**
  - `books.json` → Book records
  - `logs.csv` → Borrow & return history
- **Visualization:** Matplotlib 📊

- Lambda functions for quick calculations
- Conditional checks for availability
- JSON & CSV file handling for persistence
- Data aggregation for insights

---

## 📊 Visual Insights
- 📊 **Bar Chart** → Top borrowed books
- 🥧 **Pie Chart** → Genre-wise popularity
- Makes analysis fast, clean, and intuitive

---

## ✅ Results
- Accurate tracking of book usage
- Safe and persistent data storage
- Clear popularity ranking
- Reduced manual work & errors
- Beginner-friendly yet practical

---

## 🎯 Conclusion
This project blends **traditional library systems** with **modern Python automation**.
